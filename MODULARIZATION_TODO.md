# Modularization Todo List

## 1. Inventory & Analyze Codebase
- Audit current files and functions.
- List functionalities and responsibilities.

## 2. Define Module Boundaries
- Group related functionalities based on domain (e.g., authentication, data access, business logic).
- Ensure single responsibility per script (one function per script when appropriate).

## 3. Create Organized Directory Structure
- Create an `app.py` as the main entry point.
- Create directories such as `modules/` for core functionalities and `utils/` for helper functions.

## 4. Refactor Functions
- Move each function to its respective file in the modules (or utilities) folder.
- Use clear and descriptive naming conventions.

## 5. Setup `app.py`
- Import functions from various modules.
- Orchestrate the application flow and handle initialization.

## 6. Update Documentation
- Update `README.md` to reflect the new structure.
- Add in-code docstrings and comments for clarity.

## 7. Create Tests
- Write unit tests for each module.
- Develop integration tests to ensure modules work together as expected.

## 8. Validate & Iterate
- Run `app.py` to verify functionality.
- Iterate based on testing feedback, fixing bugs and improving design.
